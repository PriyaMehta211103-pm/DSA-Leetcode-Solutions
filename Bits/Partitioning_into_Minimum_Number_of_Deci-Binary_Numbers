/* Problem : Partitioning into Minimum Number of Deci-Binary Numbers
Platform:Leetcode
Difficulty:Medium
Link:https://leetcode.com/problems/partitioning-into-minimum-number-of-deci-binary-numbers/description/


//Intuition
Let’s think practically.
Suppose:
n = "32"
To construct digit 3 at tens place, you need at least 3 deci-binary numbers, because each deci-binary number can contribute at most 1 at that position.
Similarly:
n = "82734"
The maximum digit here is 8.
That means:
To build digit 8, you need at least 8 deci-binary numbers
No matter what other digits are, you cannot do it in fewer than 8
✨ So the answer is simply the maximum digit present in the string.
That’s it.
The problem looks complex, but the logic is beautifully simple.


//Approach
Traverse through the string n.
Find the maximum digit.
Return its integer value.
Since n can be very large (up to 10⁵ digits), we must treat it as a string.

//Code
class Solution {
public:
    int minPartitions(string n) {
        char  maxCh=*max_element(begin(n),end(n));
        return maxCh-'0';
    }
};



//Time Complexity

O(N)
(We scan the string once.)

// Space Complexity
O(1)
(No extra space used.)
